The definition of artistic activity occurs, first of all, in the field of distribution.

One of the ways in which the Conceptual project in art has
been most successful is in claiming new territory for practice.
It’s a tendency that’s been almost too successful: today
it seems that most of the work in the international art system
positions itself as Conceptual to some degree, yielding the
“Conceptual painter,” the “DJ and Conceptual artist,” or the
“Conceptual web artist.” Let’s put aside the question of what
makes a work Conceptual, recognizing, with some resignation,
that the term can only gesture toward a thirty year-old
historical moment. But it can’t be rejected entirely, as it has
an evident charge for artists working today, even if they
aren’t necessarily invested in the concerns of the classical
moment, which included linguistics, analytic philosophy, and
a pursuit of formal dematerialization. What does seem to
hold true for today’s normative Conceptualism is
that the project remains, in the words of Art and
Language, “radically incomplete”: it does not
necessarily stand against objects or painting, or
for language as art; it does not need to stand
against retinal art; it does not stand for anything
certain, instead privileging framing and context,
and constantly renegotiating its relationship to its
audience. Martha Rosler has spoken of the “asif”
approach, where the Conceptual work cloaks
itself in other disciplines (philosophy being the
most notorious example), provoking an oscillation
between skilled and de-skilled, authority and pretense,
style and strategy, art and not-art.

Communicative web software lends itself well to function as a dispersed gallery.

The aim of the project is to document location of art, whether geographically, by uri, or beyond in a social and analyzable way to better assist interaction with art however possible. With an endless goal of better facilitating art experiences, the highest hope is that the intersection of software and gallery breaches into the sphere of art object itself, though maybe only in innevitably sharing normative Conceptualism's property; "radically incomplete"
